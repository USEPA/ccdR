The CHEMINV file includes all chemical samples procured by Evotec for possible inclusion in EPA's ToxCast program since the start of the program in 2007, as well as a relatively small set of donated or EPA-supplied samples that were shipped to Evotec to be included in EPA's physical sample library. The list includes all samples received and registered by Evotec, but all samples were not necessarily solubilized or plated for testing, i.e., the full list includes volatiles, DMSO insolubles, depleted chemicals, and discarded chemicals deemed too dangerous for storage and handling.  All physical samples plated for screening in the ToxCast program (TOXCAST), which includes EPA's full contribution to the Tox21 screening program (TOX21SL), are included as a subset of CHEMINV, as is the full list of samples currently available for ToxCast plating. Hence, the CHEMINV inventory file is a snapshot of all past and present samples. The CHEMINV file provides a complete historical record of chemicals that were prioritized for inclusion in EPA's ToxCast and Tox21 screening programs based on multiple criteria (toxicity data, exposure potential, use, etc.), and that were successfully procured by (or provided to) EPA's ToxCast Chemical Contractor (Evotec) for possible inclusion in those programs. The CHEMINV file is a subset of EPA's ChemTrack database (CHEMTRACK), the latter including all chemicals for which ToxCast or Tox21 screening data have been generated. CHEMTRACK additionally includes reference chemicals for which data were provided by ToxCast collaborators, as well as Tox21 chemicals not in EPA's physical inventory that were separately provided by Tox21 federal testing partners (the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences).

        "longDescription": "The EPA Fathead Minnow Acute Toxicity database was generated by the U.S. EPA Mid-Continental Ecology Division (MED) for the purpose of developing an expert system to predict acute toxicity from chemical structure based on mode of action considerations. Hence, an important and unusual characteristic of this toxicity database is that the 617 tested industrial organic chemicals were expressly chosen to serve as a useful training set for development of predictive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). A second valuable aspect of this database, from a QSAR modeling perspective, is the inclusion of general mode-of-action (MOA) classifications of acute toxicity response for individual chemicals derived from study results. These MOA assignments are biologically based classifications, allowing definition of chemical similarity based upon biological activity instead of organic chemistry functional class as most commonly employed in QSAR study. MOA classifications should strengthen the scientific basis for construction of individual QSARs. However, it is cautioned that the broad MOA categorizations should not be construed to represent a single molecular mechanism; for example, CNS seizure agents and respiratory inhibitors are known to act through a variety of receptors. The DSSTox EPAFHM database includes information pertaining to organic chemical class assignments (ChemClass_FHM), acute toxicity in fathead minnow (LC50_mg), dose-response assessments (LC50_Ratio, ExcessToxicityIndex), behavioral assessments (FishBehaviorTest), joint toxicity MOA evaluations of mixtures (MOA_MixtureTest), and additional MOA evaluation of fish acute toxicity syndrome (FishAcuteToxSyndrome) in rainbow trout. All of these indicators, to the extent available, were considered in the determination of MOA and, additionally, were used to determine a level of confidence in the MOA assignment for each chemical (MOA_Confidence).

NATA assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources but, rather, use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them.\r\n\r\nNATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing (inhaling) air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics, emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk.  This in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest.  Assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, including assessments of non-cancer health effects for Diesel Particulate Matter (PM). Assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged.",

        "longDescription": "List consists of all records with a structure assigned, and using a combination of a set of substructural filters and percent of fluorine in the molecular formula ignoring all hydrogen atoms. For example, for a compound with the molecular formula C6HF9O6, the percent of fluorine excluding hydrogen contained in the formula would be 9F/(6C + 9F + 6O) = 42%. A threshold of 30% fluorine without hydrogen allows for inclusion of some of the complex highly fluorinated structures. The combination of the set of substructural filters (<a href='https://www.epa.gov/system/files/images/2022-10/PFAS%20substructure%20image_PFASSTRUCTv5.jpg' target='_blank'>visible here, where the heteroatom Q can be B, O, N, P, S, or Si<\/a>) are designed to be simple, reproducible and transparent, yet general enough to encompass the largest set of structures having sufficient levels of fluorination to potentially impart PFAS-type properties. The combination of substructural filters and threshold of percentage of fluorination were identified in the development of the manuscript \"A Proposed approach to defining per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) based on molecular structure and formula\" by Gaines et al.

This list is designed to help manufacturers find safer chemical alternatives that meet the criteria of the Safer Choice Program.\r\nBefore Safer Choice decides to include a chemical on the SCIL, a third-party profiler (i.e., NSF, International or ToxServices) gathers hazard information from a broad set of resources, including the identification and evaluation of all available toxicological and environmental fate data. The third party profiler submits a report to Safer Choice, with a recommendation on whether the chemical passes the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients. Safer Choice staff performs due diligence by reviewing the submission for completeness, consistency, and compliance with the Safer Choice Criteria. If more than one third-party has evaluated the chemical, Safer Choice also checks for differences in the profiles and resolves any conflicts. In some cases, Safer Choice may also perform additional literature reviews and consider data from confidential sources, such as EPA's New Chemicals Program. Safer Choice does not typically examine primary literature (original studies) as part of its review and listing decisions.\r\nThe list is not intended to be exclusive. Chemicals may be submitted as part of a formulation that the program has yet to review or a chemical manufacturer may develop a chemical to meet the Safer Choice criteria. If these chemicals meet our criteria, they may be approved for use in Safer Choice-labeled products and added to the SCIL. Chemicals may be removed from the list or have their status changed based on new data or innovations that raise the safer-chemistry bar. Safer Choice will ensure that no confidential or trade secret information appears in this list.",

Information about what types of substances are on the TSCA inventory can be found here. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), as amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, requires EPA to designate chemical substances on the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory as either “active” or “inactive” in U.S. commerce. To accomplish this, EPA finalized a rule requiring industry reporting of chemicals manufactured (including imported) or processed in the U.S.. This reporting is used to identify which chemical substances on the TSCA Inventory are active in U.S. commerce and help inform the prioritization of chemicals for risk evaluation.

Publication in the Federal Register activates a statutory requirement for EPA to complete the prioritization process in the next nine to twelve months, allowing EPA to designate 20 chemicals as high priority and 20 chemicals as low priority by December 2019.

The Work Plan was updated in October 2014. The changes to the TSCA Work Plan reflect updated data submitted to EPA by chemical companies on chemical releases and potential exposures.\r\n\r\nAfter gathering input from stakeholders, EPA developed criteria used for identifying chemicals for further assessment. The criteria focused on chemicals that meet one or more of the following factors:\r\n\r\nPotentially of concern to children’s health (for example, because of reproductive or developmental effects)\r\n\r\nNeurotoxic effects\r\nPersistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic (PBT)\r\nProbable or known carcinogens\r\nUsed in children’s products\r\nDetected in biomonitoring programs\r\n\r\nUsing this process, EPA in 2012 identified  chemicals in the TSCA Work Plan as candidates for assessment over the next several years, as they all scored high in this screening process based on their combined hazard, exposure, and persistence and bioaccumulation characteristics. In 2014, using new information submitted to the Agency, EPA updated the TSCA Work Plan.",
