        "longDescription": "CERAPP (Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project) is a large-scale modeling project demonstrate the efficacy of using predictive computational models trained on high-throughput screening data to evaluate thousands of chemicals for ER-related activity and prioritize them for further testing. CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure–activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies. The work is described in this peer-reviewed publication: <a href='https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510267' target='_blank'>https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510267<\/a>",

Accompanying data-gathering, testing, and environmental monitoring exercises, in turn, have led to the publication and sharing of various lists of PFAS chemicals, some exceeding several thousand substances. A major effort was undertaken by EPA researchers within the National Center for Computational Toxicology to curate and structure-annotate several public lists in DSSTox. The below list of registered PFAS lists, from within and outside EPA, encompass PFAS of potential interest based on environmental occurrence (through literature reports and analytical detection) and manufacturing process data, as well as lists of PFAS chemicals procured for testing within EPA research programs. The consolidated list contains a number of PFAS CAS-name substances, with a subset represented with defined chemical structures. There is no precisely clear definition of what constitutes a PFAS substance given the inclusion of partially fluorinated substances, polymers, and ill-defined reaction products on these various lists. Hence, PFASMASTER serves as a consolidated list of substances spanning and bounded by the below lists, defining a practical boundary of PFAS chemical space (within DSSTox) of current interest to researchers and regulators worldwide.

Each compound has been carefully measured in a series of controlled conditions to enable accurate, reliable, and reproducible search results in a variety of settings. It is combined with a tailor-made search algorithm to create a robust and transferable identification tool. The database can be searched with data from any type of tandem mass spectrometric instrument. Compounds covered include illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, endogenous compounds and other small bioorganic molecules. The library has been developed by Herbert Oberacher (Institute of Legal Medicine of the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria).
