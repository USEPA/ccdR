Indeed, the CWC includes in its definition of chemical weapons  “any chemical (emphasis added) which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals.” Hence, any weapon designed to bring about death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm through the toxic properties of chemicals is to be considered a chemical weapon, and any toxic chemical at the basis of such weapons is to be considered a chemical warfare agent.\r\n\r\nThis data collection is sourced from the <a href='https://costanziresearch.com/cw-nonproliferation/cw-control-lists/cwc-schedules/' target='_blank'>Constanzi Research group<\/a>.",

        "longDescription": "CERAPP (Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project) is a large-scale modeling project demonstrate the efficacy of using predictive computational models trained on high-throughput screening data to evaluate thousands of chemicals for ER-related activity and prioritize them for further testing. CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure–activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies. The work is described in this peer-reviewed publication: <a href='https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510267' target='_blank'>https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510267<\/a>",

The Norman Early Warning System (NormaNEWS) is a collaborative activity aimed at members active in non-target analysis. The concept of NormaNEWS is that when one group identifies a new contaminant of emerging concern identification criteria are sent to other members of the group who use retrospective analysis techniques to check their own samples. This way we can rapidly establish the occurrence of newly identified compounds of emerging concern across Europe and beyond. NormaNEWS is lead by Kevin Thomas at NIVA (Norway) / University of Queensland (Australia) as part of the Non-target screening cross-working group activity of the NORMAN network.
