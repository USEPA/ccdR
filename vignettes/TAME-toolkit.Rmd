# Introduction

Accessing chemical data and wrangling it is a vital step in many types of workflows related to chemical, biological, and environmental modelling. While there are many resources available from which one can pull data, the [CompTox Chemicals Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/)(CCD) built and maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency is particularly well-designed and maintained. Originally introduced in [The CompTox Chemistry Dashboard: a community data resource for environmental chemistry](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-017-0247-6), the CCD contains information on over 1.2 million chemicals as of September, 2023. Information contained for chemicals featured in the CCD include but are not limited to phys-chem properties, documentation and curation information of the featured data, hazard and fate/transport data. One can see an example of this in the search for the chemical Bisphenol A.

As one may observe, on the left side of the image there are several tabs that contain information such as physico-chemical properties, Environmental Fate and Transport data, and hazard data among others. The data contained in these tabs is freely accessible but not necessarily in the best format for data wrangling.

One can use the batch search functionality of the CCD to pull together desired data for a specific user supplied list of chemicals.

One can download the selected information in various formats, such as a excel, csv, or different types of MOL files. While this is suitable for many projects, it does not necessarily work well when a programmatic approach to a modelling problem is desired. The steps involving inputting chemical identifier information, exporting into a file, loading and wrangling the data from file is both time consuming and a potential source of human error that may be hard to identify after the fact. 

## CCTE APIs

Recently, the [Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-center-computational-toxicology-and-exposure-ccte)(CCTE) developed APIs that allow users to access the information curated and maintained within the CCD. The [CCTE APIs](https://api-ccte.epa.gov/docs/) are publicly available at no cost to the user. The first step for interacting with the information available through the APIs is acquiring an API key, by contacting the API support team at [ccte_api@epa.gov](ccte_api@epa.gov).

The APIs are organized into three sections of endpoints, `Chemical`, `Hazard`, and `Bioactivity`.Pictured below is what the `Chemical` section looks like and can be found at [CCTE API Chemical Endpoints](https://api-ccte.epa.gov/docs/chemical.html).

![CCTE API Chemical Endpoints](./Pictures/CCTE Chemical API endpoints.png){width=120%}

Notice that Authentication is the first tab on the left and below it are several endpoints organized by what purpose they serve. Authentication is required to use the APIs and the API key authenticates the user. The endpoints are organized into categories of functional use, for instance providing basic information on a chemical in the `Chemical Details Resource`, more comprehensive physico-chemical properties in `Chemical Property Resource`, chemical fate and transport data in `Chemical Fate Resource`, and so on. Also notice that next to each endpoint is a box that indicates what the associated http request is to access the information. These are either a Post or a Get request. Clicking on the `Get data by DTXSID`, we observe that there are certain required pieces of information to construct the request and optional parameters to focus the request.

![CCTE Get Details by DTXSID](./Pictures/Get Data by DTXSID TOP.png){width=120%}

The user is required to supply a string for the DTXSID and an optional `projection` parameter, which controls the scope of the information returned. The default return format is displayed below and includes a variety of fields with data types represented.

We show what returned data from searching Bisphenol A looks like using this endpoint with the `chemicaldetailstandard` projection selected.

Formatting an http request is not necessarily intuitive nor worth the time for someone not already familiar with the process, so these endpoints may provide a resource that for many would require a significant investment in time and energy to learn how to use. However, there is a solution to this in the form of the R package ccdR.

This R package was developed to streamline the process of accessing the information available through the CCTE APIs without requiring prior knowledge of how to use APIs. As an example, we demonstrate the ease with which one may retrieve the information given by this endpoint for Bisphenol A using the ccdR approach and contrast it with the approach using the CCD or CCTE Chemical Endpoint website.

First, we load in ccdR and other libraries we will need for this module.

### Installing required R packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace('ccdR'))
  install.packages('ccdR');
```

### Loading R packages required for this session

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ccdR)
```

First, we store the API key required to access the APIs. To do this for the current session, run the first command. If you want to store your key across multiple sessions, run the second command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# This stores the key in the current session
register_ccdr(key = '<YOUR API KEY>')

# This stores the key across multiple sessions and only needs to be run once. 
# If the key changes, rerun this with the new key.
register_ccdr(key = '<YOUR API KEY>', write = TRUE)
```

To check that your key has successfully been stored for the session, run the following command.

```{r}
ccte_key()
```
Now, we demonstrate how to retrieve the information for BPA given by the `Chemical Detail Resource` endpoint under the `chemicaldetailstandard` projection. Note, this projection is the default projection for the function `get_chemical_details()`.

```{r}
BPA_chemical_detail <- get_chemical_details(DTXSID = 'DTXSID7020182')
BPA_chemical_detail
class(BPA_chemical_detail)
names(BPA_chemical_detail)
```
















# Physico-chemical properties

We study two different data sets contained in the CCD and observe how they relate and how they differ. The two data sets that we will first explore are the water contaminant priority list, ccl3, and NATA air pollutants. These can be found in the CCD at [CCL3](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/CCL3) with additional information at [CCL3 information](https://www.epa.gov/ccl/contaminant-candidate-list-3-ccl-3) and [NATADB](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/NATADB). !!!ADD IN DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THESE DATA SETS!!!

We explore details about these before diving into analyzing the data contained in each list.

```{r}
ccl3_information <- get_public_chemical_list_by_name('CCL3')
ccl3_information

natadb_information <- get_public_chemical_list_by_name('NATADB')
natadb_information
```

Now we pull the actual chemicals contained in the lists using the APIs.

```{r}
ccl3 <- get_chemicals_in_list('CCL3')
ccl3 <- data.table::as.data.table(ccl3)

natadb <- get_chemicals_in_list('NATADB')
natadb <- data.table::as.data.table(natadb)

ccl3
natadb
```



We do a few comparisons of phys-chem properties on chemicals from a few different lists from the CCD. In particular, we examine the vapor pressure of chemicals found in the [ASPECT](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/ASPECT) list and the [USGS](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/USGSWATER) list, which roughly focus on chemicals found in air and water, respectively.
