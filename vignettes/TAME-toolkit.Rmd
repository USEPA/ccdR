# Introduction

Accessing chemical data and wrangling it is a vital step in many types of workflows related to chemical, biological, and environmental modelling. While there are many resources available from which one can pull data, the [CompTox Chemicals Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/)(CCD) built and maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency is particularly well-designed and maintained. The CCD contains information on over 1.2 million chemicals as of 9/11/2023, ranging from ... One can see an example of this in the search for the chemical Bisphenol A. ![Bisphenol A landing page](./Pictures/CCD BPA page.png){width=120%}

As one may observe, on the left side of the image there are several tabs that contain information such as physico-chemical properties, Environmental Fate and Transport data, and hazard data among others. The data contained in these tabs is freely accessible but not necessarily in the best format for data wrangling.

One can use the batch search functionality of the CCD to pull together desired data for a specific user supplied list of chemicals. ![CCD Batch Search](./Pictures/CCD Batch Search.png){width=120%} One can download the selected information in various formats, such as a excel, csv, or different types of MOL files. While this is suitable for many projects, it does not necessarily work well when a programmatic approach to a modelling problem is desired. The steps involving inputting chemical identifier information, exporting into a file, loading and wrangling the file is both time consuming and a potential source of human error that may be hard to identify later on. 

## CCTE APIs

Recently, the [Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-center-computational-toxicology-and-exposure-ccte)(CCTE) developed APIs that allow users to access the information curated and maintained within the CCD. The [CCTE APIs](https://api-ccte.epa.gov/docs/) are publicly available at no cost to the user. The first step for interacting with the information available through the APIs is acquiring an API key, by contacting the API support team at [ccte_api@epa.gov](ccte_api@epa.gov).

The APIs are organized into three sections of endpoints, `Chemical`, `Hazard`, and `Bioactivity`.















# Physico-chemical properties


We do a few comparisons of phys-chem properties on chemicals from a few different lists from the CCD. In particular, we examine the vapor pressure of chemicals found in the [ASPECT](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/ASPECT) list and the [USGS](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/USGSWATER) list, which roughly focus on chemicals found in air and water, respectively.
