# Introduction to Training Module

This training module provides an overview of the publicly available databases at US EPA that provide physico-chemical, hazard, and bioactivity data, avenues through which to access the information stored in these databases, and how to use this data. We will first introduce these resources and how one may access them. Then we will focus on one specific method for retrieving data. Through some basic data visualization and analysis, we will explore this data and gain insights both in how to wrangle the data and combine different methods of accessing the data to build automated pipelines for use in more complex settings.

# Training Module's Environmental Health Questions

This training module was specifically developed to answer the following questions:

1. After automatically pulling the fourth Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List from the CompTox Dashboard, list the properties and property types present in the data. What are the mean values for a specific property when grouped by property type and when ungrouped?

2. The physico-chemical property data are reported with both experimental and predicted values present for many chemicals. Are there differences between the mean predicted and experimental results for a variety of physico-chemical properties?

3. After pulling the genotoxicity data for the different environmental contaminant data sets, list the assays associated with the chemicals in each data set. How many unique assays are there in each data set? What are the different assay categories and how many unique assays for each assay category are there?

4. The genotoxicity data contains information on which assays have been conducted for different chemicals and the results of those assays. How many chemicals in each data set have a ‘positive’, ‘negative’, and ‘equivocal’ value for the assay result?

5. Based on the genotoxicity data reported for the chemical with DTXSID identifier DTXSID0020153, how many assays resulted in a positive/equivocal/negative value? Which of the assays were positive and how many of each were there for the most reported assays?

6. After pulling the hazard data for the different data sets, list the different exposure routes for which there is data. What are the unique risk assessment classes for hazard values for the oral route and for the inhalation exposure route? For each such exposure route, which risk assessment class is most represented by the data sets?

7. There are several types of toxicity values for each exposure route. List the unique toxicity values for the oral and inhalation routes. What are the unique types of toxicity values for the oral route and for the inhalation route? How many of these are common to both the oral and inhalation routes for each data set?

8. When examining different toxicity values, the data may be reported in multiple units. To assess the relative hazard from this data, it is important to take into account the different units and adjust accordingly. List the units reported for the cancer slope factor, reference dose, and reference concentration values associated with the oral and inhalation exposure routes for human hazard. Which chemicals in each data set has the highest cancer slope factor, lowest reference dose, and lowest reference concentration values?

# Introduction to CompTox Chemicals Dashboard

Accessing chemical data and wrangling it is a vital step in many types of workflows related to chemical, biological, and environmental modeling. While there are many resources available from which one can pull data, the [CompTox Chemicals Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/)(CCD) built and maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency is particularly well-designed and maintained. Originally introduced in [The CompTox Chemistry Dashboard: a community data resource for environmental chemistry](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-017-0247-6), the CCD contains information on over 1.2 million chemicals as of September, 2023. Information contained for chemicals featured in the CCD include but are not limited to physico-chemical properties, documentation and curation information of the featured data, hazard and fate/transport data. One can see an example of this in the search for the chemical Bisphenol A. 

![Bisphenol A landing page](./Pictures/CCD BPA page.png){width=120%}

As one may observe, on the left side of the image there are several tabs that contain information such as physico-chemical properties, Environmental Fate and Transport data, and hazard data among others. The data contained in these tabs is freely accessible but not necessarily in the best format for data wrangling.

One can use the batch search functionality of the CCD to pull together desired data for a specific user supplied list of chemicals.

![CCD Batch Search](./Pictures/CCD Batch Search.png){width=120%}

One can download the selected information in various formats, such as a excel (.xlsx), comma-separated values (.csv), or different types of chemical table files (.e.g, MOL). While this is suitable for many projects, it does not necessarily work well when a programmatic approach to a modeling problem is desired. The steps involving inputting chemical identifier information, exporting into a file, loading and wrangling the data from file is both time consuming and a potential source of human error that may be hard to identify after the fact. 

## Recent Updates on CCTE's (Application Prgramming Interface (API) for Improved Data Access

Recently, the [Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-center-computational-toxicology-and-exposure-ccte)(CCTE) developed an Application Programming Interface (API) that allow users to access the information curated and maintained within the CCD. The [CCTE APIs](https://api-ccte.epa.gov/docs/) are publicly available at no cost to the user. The first step for interacting with the information available through the APIs is acquiring an API key, by contacting the API support team at [ccte_api@epa.gov](mailto:ccte_api@epa.gov).

The APIs are organized into three sections of endpoints, `Chemical`, `Hazard`, and `Bioactivity`.Pictured below is what the `Chemical` section looks like and can be found at [CCTE API Chemical Endpoints](https://api-ccte.epa.gov/docs/chemical.html).

![CCTE API Chemical Endpoints](./Pictures/CCTE Chemical API endpoints.png){width=120%}

Notice that Authentication is the first tab on the left and below it are several endpoints organized by what purpose they serve. Authentication is required to use the APIs and the API key authenticates the user. The endpoints are organized into categories of functional use, for instance providing basic information on a chemical in the `Chemical Details Resource`, more comprehensive physico-chemical properties in `Chemical Property Resource`, chemical fate and transport data in `Chemical Fate Resource`, and so on. Also notice that next to each endpoint is a box that indicates what the associated http request is to access the information. These are either a Post or a Get request. Clicking on the `Get data by DTXSID`, we observe that there are certain required pieces of information to construct the request and optional parameters to focus the request.

![CCTE Get Details by DTXSID](./Pictures/Get Data by DTXSID TOP.png){width=120%}

The user is required to supply a string for the DTXSID and an optional `projection` parameter, which controls the scope of the information returned. The default return format is displayed below and includes a variety of fields with data types represented.

![CCTE Get Details by DTXSID data types](./Pictures/Get Data by DTXSID BOTTOM.png){width=120%}
We show what returned data from searching Bisphenol A looks like using this endpoint with the `chemicaldetailstandard` projection selected.

![Bisphenol A output](./Pictures/BPA chemicaldetailstandard.png){width=120%}



Formatting an http request is not necessarily intuitive nor worth the time for someone not already familiar with the process, so these endpoints may provide a resource that for many would require a significant investment in time and energy to learn how to use. However, there is a solution to this in the form of the R package ccdR.

This R package was developed to streamline the process of accessing the information available through the CCTE APIs without requiring prior knowledge of how to use APIs. As an example, we demonstrate the ease with which one may retrieve the information given by this endpoint for Bisphenol A using the ccdR approach and contrast it with the approach using the CCD or CCTE Chemical Endpoint website.

First, we load in ccdR and other libraries we will need for this module.

### Installing required R packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace('ccdR'))
  install.packages('ccdR');
```

### Loading R packages required for this session

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ccdR)
```

First, we store the API key required to access the APIs. To do this for the current session, run the first command. If you want to store your key across multiple sessions, run the second command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# This stores the key in the current session
register_ccdr(key = '<YOUR API KEY>')

# This stores the key across multiple sessions and only needs to be run once. 
# If the key changes, rerun this with the new key.
register_ccdr(key = '<YOUR API KEY>', write = TRUE)
```

To check that your key has successfully been stored for the session, run the following command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ccte_key()
```
Now, we demonstrate how to retrieve the information for BPA given by the `Chemical Detail Resource` endpoint under the `chemicaldetailstandard` projection. Note, this projection is the default projection for the function `get_chemical_details()`.

```{r}
BPA_chemical_detail <- get_chemical_details(DTXSID = 'DTXSID7020182')
dim(BPA_chemical_detail)
class(BPA_chemical_detail)
names(BPA_chemical_detail)
```


# Comparing Physico-chemical properties between Two Important Environmental Contaminant Lists

We study two different data sets contained in the CCD and observe how they relate and how they differ. The two data sets that we will explore are a water contaminant priority list and an air toxics list.  

The fourth Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List (CCL4) is a set of chemicals not subject to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking water regulations, but are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems. This list was announced on November 17, 2016 and includes 97 chemicals or chemical groups and 12 microbial contaminants. The National-Scale Air Toxics Assessments (NATA) is an ongoing comprehensive evaluation of air toxics in the United States. It uses general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts and underestimate them and is meant for use as a tool for State/Local/Tribal agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of risks.

These can be found in the CCD at [CCL4](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/CCL4) with additional information at [CCL4 information](https://www.epa.gov/ccl/contaminant-candidate-list-4-ccl-4-0) and [NATADB](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/NATADB) with additional information at [NATA information](https://www.epa.gov/national-air-toxics-assessment).


We explore details about these two lists of chemicals before diving into analyzing the data contained in each list.

```{r}
options(width = 100)
ccl4_information <- get_public_chemical_list_by_name('CCL4')
print(ccl4_information, trunc.cols = TRUE)

natadb_information <- get_public_chemical_list_by_name('NATADB')
print(natadb_information, trunc.cols = TRUE)
```

Now we pull the actual chemicals contained in the lists using the APIs.

```{r}
ccl4 <- get_chemicals_in_list('ccl4')
ccl4 <- data.table::as.data.table(ccl4)

natadb <- get_chemicals_in_list('NATADB')
natadb <- data.table::as.data.table(natadb)
```

We examine the dimensions of the data, the column names, and display a single row for illustrative purposes.

```{r}
dim(ccl4)
dim(natadb)

colnames(ccl4)
head(ccl4, 1)
```


## Accessing the physico-chemical data

Once we have the chemicals in each list, we access their physico-chemical properties. We will use the batch search forms of the function `get_chem_info()`, to which we supply a list of DTXSIDs.

```{r}
ccl4$dtxsid
natadb$dtxsid

ccl4_phys_chem <- get_chem_info_batch(ccl4$dtxsid)
natadb_phys_chem <- get_chem_info_batch(natadb$dtxsid)
```

Observe that this returns a single data.table for each query, and the data.table contains the physico-chemical properties available from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard for each chemical in the query. We examine the set of physico-chemical properties for the first chemical in CCL4. 

Before any deeper analysis, lets take a look at the dimensions of the data and the column names.

```{r}
dim(ccl4_phys_chem)
colnames(ccl4_phys_chem)
```
Next, we display the unique values for the columns `propertyID` and `propType`.





```{r}
ccl4_phys_chem[, unique(propertyId)]
ccl4_phys_chem[, unique(propType)]
```

Let's explore this further by examining the mean of the 'boiling-point' and 'melting-point' data.

```{r}
ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId == 'boiling-point', .(Mean = mean(value))]
ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId == 'boiling-point', .(Mean = mean(value)),
               by = .(propType)]

ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId == 'melting-point', .(Mean = mean(value))]
ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId == 'melting-point', .(Mean = mean(value)),
               by = .(propType)]
```

These results tell us about some of the reported physico-chemical properties of the data sets.

*With this, we can answer **Environmental Health Question 1**:* After automatically pulling the fourth Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List from the CompTox Dashboard, list the properties and property types present in the data. What are the mean values for a specific property when grouped by property type and when ungrouped?

**Answer:** The mean 'boiling-point' is 251.1072 degrees Celsius for CCL4, with mean values of 250.5943 and 251.4001 for experimental and predicted, respectively. The mean 'melting-point' is 33.93924 degrees Celsius for CCL4, with mean values of 23.18876 and 47.98422 for experimental and predicted, respectively.


To explore **all** the values of the physico-chemical properties and calculate their means, we can do the following procedure. First we look at all the physico-chemical properties individually, then group them by each property (`boiling-point`, `melting-point`, etc...), and then additionally group those by property type (`experimental` vs `predicted`). In the grouping, we look at the columns `value`, `unit`, `propertyID` and `propType`. We also demonstrate how take the mean of the values for each grouping.

```{r}
head(ccl4_phys_chem[dtxsid == ccl4$dtxsid[[1]], ])
ccl4_phys_chem[dtxsid == ccl4$dtxsid[[1]], .(propType, value, unit),
               by = .(propertyId)]
ccl4_phys_chem[dtxsid == ccl4$dtxsid[[1]], .(value, unit), 
               by = .(propertyId, propType)]

ccl4_phys_chem[dtxsid == ccl4$dtxsid[[1]], .(Mean_value = sapply(.SD, mean)),
               by = .(propertyId, unit), .SDcols = c("value")]
ccl4_phys_chem[dtxsid == ccl4$dtxsid[[1]], .(Mean_value = sapply(.SD, mean)), 
               by = .(propertyId, unit, propType), 
               .SDcols = c("value")][order(propertyId)]
```

## Analyzing and visualizing physico-chemical properties from two environmental contaminant lists

We consider the following exploring the differences in mean predicted and experimental values for a variety of physico-chemical properties in an effort to understand better the CCL4 and NATADB lists. In particular, we examine 'vapor-pressure', 'henrys-law', and 'boiling-point' and plot the means by chemical for these using boxplots. We then compare the values by grouping by both data set and propType.



We first examine the vapor pressures for all the chemicals in each list. We then graph these, grouped by `propType` and pooled together in separate plots. For this we will use boxplots.


Group first by DTXSID.

```{r}
ccl4_vapor_all <- ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'vapor-pressure', 
                                 .(mean_vapor_pressure = sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                 .SDcols = c('value'), by = .(dtxsid)]
natadb_vapor_all <- natadb_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'vapor-pressure', 
                                     .(mean_vapor_pressure = sapply(.SD, mean)),
                                     .SDcols = c('value'), by = .(dtxsid)]
```

Then group by DTXSID and then by property type.

```{r}
ccl4_vapor_grouped <- ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'vapor-pressure', 
                                     .(mean_vapor_pressure = sapply(.SD, mean)),
                                     .SDcols = c('value'), 
                                     by = .(dtxsid, propType)]
natadb_vapor_grouped <- natadb_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'vapor-pressure', 
                                         .(mean_vapor_pressure = 
                                             sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                         .SDcols = c('value'), 
                                         by = .(dtxsid, propType)]
```

Then examine the summary statistics of the data.

```{r}
summary(ccl4_vapor_all)
summary(ccl4_vapor_grouped)
summary(natadb_vapor_all)
summary(natadb_vapor_grouped)
```

With such a large range of values covering several orders of magnitude, we log transform the data. Since these value are positive, we do not have to worry about illegal transformations.

```{r}
ccl4_vapor_all[, log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure := log(mean_vapor_pressure)]
ccl4_vapor_grouped[, log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure := 
                     log(mean_vapor_pressure)]

natadb_vapor_all[, log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure := 
                   log(mean_vapor_pressure)]
natadb_vapor_grouped[, log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure := 
                       log(mean_vapor_pressure)]
```

Now we plot the log transformed data.

First plot the CCL4 data.
```{r}
ggplot(ccl4_vapor_all, aes(log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure)) +
  geom_boxplot()
ggplot(ccl4_vapor_grouped, aes(propType, log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Then plot the NATA data.

```{r}
ggplot(natadb_vapor_all, aes(log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure)) +
  geom_boxplot()
ggplot(natadb_vapor_grouped, aes(propType, log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Finally, we compare both sets simultaneously. We add in a column to each data.table denoting to which data set the rows correspond and then `rbind` the rows from both data sets together.

```{r}
ccl4_vapor_grouped[, set := 'CCL4']
natadb_vapor_grouped[, set := 'NATADB']

all_vapor_grouped <- rbind(ccl4_vapor_grouped, natadb_vapor_grouped)
```

Now we plot the combined data. First we color the boxplots based on the property type, with mean log transformed vapor pressure plotted for each data set and property type.

```{r}
vapor_box <- ggplot(all_vapor_grouped, 
                    aes(set, log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = propType))
vapor_box
```

Next we color the boxplots based on the data set.

```{r}
vapor <- ggplot(all_vapor_grouped, aes(log_transform_mean_vapor_pressure)) +
  geom_boxplot((aes(color = set)))
vapor
```

In the plots above, when we graph the data separated both by data set and property type as well as just by data set, we observe the general trend that the NATADB chemicals have a higher mean vapor pressure than the CCL4 chemicals.

Next, we also explore Henry's Law constant and boiling point.

Group by DTXSID.

```{r}
ccl4_hlc_all <- ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'henrys-law', 
                               .(mean_hlc = sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                               .SDcols = c('value'), by = .(dtxsid)]
natadb_hlc_all <- natadb_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'henrys-law', 
                                   .(mean_hlc = sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                   .SDcols = c('value'), by = .(dtxsid)]
```

Group by DTXSID and property type.

```{r}
ccl4_hlc_grouped <- ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'henrys-law', 
                                   .(mean_hlc = sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                   .SDcols = c('value'), 
                                   by = .(dtxsid, propType)]
natadb_hlc_grouped <- natadb_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'henrys-law', 
                                       .(mean_hlc = sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                       .SDcols = c('value'), 
                                       by = .(dtxsid, propType)]
```

Examine summary statistics.

```{r}
summary(ccl4_hlc_all)
summary(ccl4_hlc_grouped)
summary(natadb_hlc_all)
summary(natadb_hlc_grouped)
```

Again, we log transform the data as it is positive and covers several orders of magnitude.

```{r}
ccl4_hlc_all[, log_transform_mean_hlc := log(mean_hlc)]
ccl4_hlc_grouped[, log_transform_mean_hlc := log(mean_hlc)]

natadb_hlc_all[, log_transform_mean_hlc := log(mean_hlc)]
natadb_hlc_grouped[, log_transform_mean_hlc := log(mean_hlc)]
```

We compare both sets simultaneously. We add in a column to each data.table denoting to which set the rows correspond and then `rbind` the rows together.


Label and combine data.

```{r}
ccl4_hlc_grouped[, set := 'CCL4']
natadb_hlc_grouped[, set := 'NATADB']

all_hlc_grouped <- rbind(ccl4_hlc_grouped, natadb_hlc_grouped)
```

Plot data.

```{r}
hlc_box <- ggplot(all_hlc_grouped, aes(set, log_transform_mean_hlc)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = propType))
hlc_box

hlc <- ggplot(all_hlc_grouped, aes(log_transform_mean_hlc)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = set))
hlc
```

Again, we observe that in both grouping by propType and aggregating all results together by data set, that the chemicals in NATADB have a generally higher mean Henry's Law Constant value than those in CCL4.

Finally, we consider boiling point.

Group by DTXSID.

```{r}
ccl4_boiling_all <- ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'boiling-point', 
                                   .(mean_boiling_point = sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                   .SDcols = c('value'), by = .(dtxsid)]
natadb_boiling_all <- natadb_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'boiling-point', 
                                       .(mean_boiling_point = 
                                           sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                       .SDcols = c('value'), by = .(dtxsid)]
```

Group by DTXSID and property type.

```{r}
ccl4_boiling_grouped <- ccl4_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'boiling-point', 
                                       .(mean_boiling_point = 
                                           sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                       .SDcols = c('value'), 
                                       by = .(dtxsid, propType)]
natadb_boiling_grouped <- natadb_phys_chem[propertyId %in% 'boiling-point', 
                                           .(mean_boiling_point = 
                                               sapply(.SD, mean)), 
                                           .SDcols = c('value'), 
                                           by = .(dtxsid, propType)]
```

Calculate summary statistics.

```{r}
summary(ccl4_boiling_all)
summary(ccl4_boiling_grouped)
summary(natadb_boiling_all)
summary(natadb_boiling_grouped)
```

Since some of the boiling point values have negative values, we cannot log transform these values. If we try, as you will see below, there will be warnings of NaNs produced.

```{r, eval}
ccl4_boiling_all[, log_transform := log(mean_boiling_point)]
ccl4_boiling_grouped[, log_transform := log(mean_boiling_point)]

natadb_boiling_all[, log_transform := log(mean_boiling_point)]
natadb_boiling_grouped[, log_transform := log(mean_boiling_point)]
```

We compare both sets simultaneously. We add in a column to each data.table denoting to which set the rows correspond and then `rbind` the rows together. We use the values as is rather than transforming them.

Label and combine data.

```{r}
ccl4_boiling_grouped[, set := 'CCL4']
natadb_boiling_grouped[, set := 'NATADB']

all_boiling_grouped <- rbind(ccl4_boiling_grouped, natadb_boiling_grouped)
```

Plot the data.

```{r}
boiling_box <- ggplot(all_boiling_grouped, aes(set, mean_boiling_point)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = propType))
boiling_box

boiling <- ggplot(all_boiling_grouped, aes(mean_boiling_point)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = set))
boiling
```

A visual inspection of this set of graphs is not as clear as in the previous cases. Note that the predicted values for each data set tend to be higher than the experimental. The mean of CCL4, by predicted and experimental appears to be greater than the corresponding means for NATADB, as does the overall mean, but the interquartile ranges of these different groupings yield slightly different results. This gives us a sense that the picture for boiling point is not as clear cut between experimental and predicted for these two data sets as the previous physico-chemical properties we investigated.

*Through inspecting the last several plots, we can answer **Environmental Health Question 2**:* The physico-chemical property data are reported with both experimental and predicted values present for many chemicals. Are there differences between the mean predicted and experimental results for a variety of physico-chemical properties? 

**Answer**: There are indeed differences between the mean values of various physico-chemical properties when grouped by predicted or experimental. In the case of `vapor-pressure`, the means of predicted values tend to be a little lower than experimental, though they are much closer in the case of NATADB than CCL4. The trend of lower predicted means compared to experimental means is more clearly demonstrated for `henrys-law` values in both data sets. In the case of `boiling-point`, the predicted values are greater than the experimental values, though this is much more pronounced in CCL4 while the set of means for NATADB are again fairly close.




# Hazard data: Genotoxicity

Now, having examined some of the distributions of the phys chem properties of the two lists, aggregated between predicted and experimental, we move towards learning more about these chemicals beyond physico-chemical properties. Specifically, we will examine their genotoxicity.

Using the standard CompTox Chemicals Dashboard approach to access genotoxicity, one would again navigate to the individual chemical page 

![CompTox Chemicals Dashboard Genotoxicity](./Pictures/BPA Hazard data - Genotoxicity.png){width=120%}


Once one navigates to the genotoxicity tab highlighted in the previous page, the following is displayed.

![CompTox Chemicals Dashboard BPA Genotoxicity](./Pictures/CCD BPA genotoxicity.png){width=120%}

This page includes two sets of information, the first of which provides a summary of available genotoxicity data while the second provides the individual reports and samples of such data.

We again use the CCTE APIs to streamline the process of retrieving this information in a programmatic fashion. To this end, we will use the genotoxicity endpoints found within the hazard endpoints of the CCTE APIs. Pictured below is the particular set of genotoxicity resources available in the hazard endpoints of the CCTE APIs.

![CCTE APIs Hazard endpoint gentoxocity resources](./Pictures/Hazard - genotoxicity resource.png){width=120%}

There are both summary and detail resources, reflecting the information one can find on the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard Genotoxicity page for a given chemical.

To access the genetox endpoint, we will use the function `get_genetox_summary`. Since we have a list of chemicals, rather than searching individually for each chemical, we use the batch search version of the function, named `get_genetox_summary_batch`. We will examine this and then access the details.

Grab the data using the APIs.
```{r}
ccl4_genotox <- get_genetox_summary_batch(DTXSID = ccl4$dtxsid)
natadb_genetox <- get_genetox_summary_batch(DTXSID = natadb$dtxsid)
```

Examine the dimensions.

```{r}
dim(ccl4_genotox)
dim(natadb_genetox)
```

Examine the column names and data from the first six chemicals with genetox data from CCL4.

```{r}
colnames(ccl4_genotox)
head(ccl4_genotox)
```

The information returned is of the first variety highlighted in the figure `CompTox Chemicals Dashboard Genotoxicity`, that is, summary data on the available genotoxicity data for each chemical.

Observe that we have information on 71 chemicals from the CCL4 data and 153 from the NATA data. We note the chemicals not included in the results and then dig into the returned results.

```{r}
ccl4[!(dtxsid %in% ccl4_genotox$dtxsid), 
     .(dtxsid, casrn, preferredName, molFormula)]
natadb[!(dtxsid %in% natadb_genetox$dtxsid), 
       .(dtxsid, casrn, preferredName, molFormula)]
```

Now, we access the genotoxicity details of the chemicals in each data set using the function `get_genetox_details_batch`. We explore the dimensions of the returned queries, the column names, and the first few lines of the data.

Grab the data from the CCTE APIs.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details <- get_genetox_details_batch(DTXSID = ccl4$dtxsid)
natadb_genetox_details <- get_genetox_details_batch(DTXSID = natadb$dtxsid)
```

Examine the dimensions.

```{r}
dim(ccl4_genetox_details)
dim(natadb_genetox_details)
```

Look at the column names and the first six rows of the data from the CCL4 chemicals.

```{r}
colnames(ccl4_genetox_details)
head(ccl4_genetox_details)
```

We examine the information returned for the first chemical in each set of results, which is DTXSID0020153. Notice that the information is identical in each case as this information is chemical specific and not data set specific.

Look at the dimensions first.

```{r}
dim(ccl4_genetox_details[dtxsid %in% 'DTXSID0020153', ])
dim(natadb_genetox_details[dtxsid %in% 'DTXSID0020153', ])
```

Now examine the first few rows.

```{r}
head(ccl4_genetox_details[dtxsid %in% 'DTXSID0020153', ])
```

Observe that the data is the same for each data set when restricting to the same chemical. This is because the information we are retrieving is specific to the chemical and not dependent on which chemical lists the chemical may belong.

```{r}
identical(ccl4_genetox_details[dtxsid %in% 'DTXSID0020153', ], 
          natadb_genetox_details[dtxsid %in% 'DTXSID0020153', ])
```


We now explore the assays present for chemicals in each data set. We first determine the unique values of the `assayCategory` and then group by these values and determine the number of unique assays in each `assayCategory` value.

Determine the unique assay categories.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details[, unique(assayCategory)]
natadb_genetox_details[, unique(assayCategory)]
```
Determine the unique assays for each data set and list them.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details[, unique(assayType)]

natadb_genetox_details[, unique(assayType)]
```





Determine the number of assays per unique assay category.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details[, .(Assays = length(unique(assayType))), 
                     by = .(assayCategory)]

natadb_genetox_details[, .(Assays = length(unique(assayType))),
                       by = .(assayCategory)]
```


We can analyze these results more closely, counting the number of assay results and grouping by assayCategory, and assayType. We also examine the different numbers of assayCategory and assayTypes used.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details[, .N, by = .(assayCategory, assayType, assayResult)]
ccl4_genetox_details[, .N, by = .(assayCategory)]
```

We look at the assayTypes and numbers of each for the three different assayCategory values.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details[assayCategory == 'in vitro', .N, by = .(assayType)]
ccl4_genetox_details[assayCategory == 'ND', .N, by = .(assayType)]
ccl4_genetox_details[assayCategory == 'in vivo', .N, by = .(assayType)]
```

Now we repeat this for `NATADB`.

```{r}
natadb_genetox_details[, .N, by = .(assayCategory, assayType, assayResult)]
natadb_genetox_details[, .N, by = .(assayCategory)]
```

Examine the number of assay types by each assay category.

```{r, R.options=list(width=150) }
natadb_genetox_details[assayCategory == 'in vitro', .N, by = .(assayType)]
natadb_genetox_details[assayCategory == 'ND', .N, by = .(assayType)]
natadb_genetox_details[assayCategory == 'in vivo', .N, by = .(assayType)]
```

*From these initial explorations of the data, we can answer **Environmental Health Question 3**:* After pulling the genotoxicity data for the different environmental contaminant data sets, list the assays associated with the chemicals in each data set. How many unique assays are there in each data set? What are the different assay categories and how many unique assays for each assay category are there?

**Answer**: There are 90 unique assays for CCl4 and 114 unique assays for NATADB. The different assay categories are 'in vitro', 'ND', and 'in vivo', with 65 unique 'in vitro' assays for CCl4 and 83 for NATADB, 3 unique 'ND' assays for CCL4 and 3 for NATADB, and 22 unique 'in vivo' assays for CCL4 and 28 for NATADB.


Next, we dig into the results of the assays. One may be interested in looking at the number of chemicals for which an assay resulted in a positive or negative result for instance. We group by assayResult and determine the number of unique dtxsids associated with each value.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details[, .(DTXSIDs = length(unique(dtxsid))), by = .(assayResult)]
natadb_genetox_details[, .(DTXSIDs = length(unique(dtxsid))), 
                       by = .(assayResult)]
```
*With this data we may now answer **Environmental Health Question 4**:* The genotoxicity data contains information on which assays have been conducted for different chemicals and the results of those assays. How many chemicals in each data set have a ‘positive’, ‘negative’, and ‘equivocal’ value for the assay result?

**Answer**: For CCL4, there are 64 unique chemicals that have a negative assay result, 53 that have a positive result, and 15 that have an equivocal result. For NATADB, there are 141 unique chemicals that have a negative assay result, 130 that have a positive result, and 48 that have an equivocal result. Observe that since there are 72 unique DTXSIDs with assay reults in CCL4 and 153 in NATADB, there are several chemicals that have multiple assay results.

We now determine the chemicals from each data set that are known to have genotoxic effects. For this, we look to see which chemicals produce at least one positive response in the assayResult column.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details[, .(is_positive = any(assayResult == 'positive')), 
                     by = .(dtxsid)][is_positive == TRUE, dtxsid]
natadb_genetox_details[, .(is_positive = any(assayResult == 'positive')),
                       by = .(dtxsid)][is_positive == TRUE, dtxsid]
```

With so much genotoxicity data, let us explore this data for one chemical more deeply to get a sense of the assays and results present for it. We will explore the chemical with DTXSID0020153. We will look at the assays, the number of each type of result, and which correspond to 'positive' results. To determine this, we group by `assayResult` and calculate .N for each group. We also isolate which were positive and output a data.table with the number of each type.

```{r}
ccl4_genetox_details[dtxsid == 'DTXSID0020153', .(Number = .N), 
                     by = .(assayResult)]
ccl4_genetox_details[dtxsid == 'DTXSID0020153' & assayResult == 'positive', 
                     .(Number_of_assays = .N), by = .(assayType)][order(-Number_of_assays),]
```

*With these data.tables, we may answer **Environmental Health Question 5**:* Based on the genotoxicity data reported for the chemical with DTXSID identifier DTXSID0020153, how many assays resulted in a positive/equivocal/negative value? Which of the assays were positive and how many of each were there for the most reported assays?

**Answer**: There were five assays that produced a negative result, 22 that produced a positive result, and one that produced an equivocal result. Of the 22 positive assays, 'bacterial reverse mutation assay' and 'Ames' were the most numerous, with three each.



# Hazard resource


Finally, we examine the hazard data associated with the chemicals in each data set. For each chemical, there will be potentially hundreds of rows of hazard data, so the returned results will be much larger than in most other API endpoints.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard <- get_hazard_by_dtxsid_batch(DTXSID = ccl4$dtxsid)
natadb_hazard <- get_hazard_by_dtxsid_batch(DTXSID = natadb$dtxsid)
```

We do some preliminary exploration of the data. First we determine the dimensions of the data sets.

```{r}
dim(ccl4_hazard)
dim(natadb_hazard)
```
Next we record the column names and display the first six results in the CCL4 hazard data.

```{r}
colnames(ccl4_hazard)
head(ccl4_hazard)
```

We determine the number of unique values in the criticalEffect, supercategory, and toxvaltype columns for each data set.

The number of unique values for `criticalEffect`.

```{r}
length(ccl4_hazard[, unique(criticalEffect)])
length(natadb_hazard[, unique(criticalEffect)])
```
The number of unique values of `supercategory`.

```{r}
length(ccl4_hazard[, unique(supercategory)])
length(natadb_hazard[, unique(supercategory)])
```
The number of unique values for `toxvalType`.

```{r}
length(ccl4_hazard[, unique(toxvalType)])
length(natadb_hazard[, unique(toxvalType)])
```

Now we look at the number of entries per `supercategory`.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[, .N, by = .(supercategory)]
natadb_hazard[, .N, by = .(supercategory)]

```
With over 17,000 results for the `supercategory` value "Point of Departure" for each data set, we dig into this further.

We determine the number of rows grouped by `toxvalType` that have the "Point of Departure" `supercategory` value, and display this descending.
```{r}
ccl4_hazard[ supercategory %in% 'Point of Departure', .N, 
             by = .(toxvalType)][order(-N),]
natadb_hazard[ supercategory %in% 'Point of Departure', .N, 
               by = .(toxvalType)][order(-N),]
```

We explore `NOEL` and `LOEL` further. Let us look at the the case when `media` value is either "soil" or "water". For this, we will recover the minimum value of LOEL and NOEL for each chemical in each data set.

First, we look at soil. We order by `toxvalType` and by the minimum `toxvalNumeric` value in each group, descending.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[media %in% 'soil' & toxvalType %in% c('LOEL', 'NOEL'), 
            .(toxvalNumeric = min(toxvalNumeric)), 
            by = .(toxvalType, toxvalUnits, dtxsid)][order(toxvalType,
                                                           -toxvalNumeric)]
natadb_hazard[media %in% 'soil' & toxvalType %in% c('LOEL', 'NOEL'), 
              .(toxvalNumeric = min(toxvalNumeric)), 
              by = .(toxvalType, toxvalUnits, dtxsid)][order(toxvalType,
                                                             -toxvalNumeric)]
```

Next we look at water, repeating the same grouping and ordering as in the previous case.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[media %in% 'water' & toxvalType %in% c('LOEL', 'NOEL'), 
            .(toxvalNumeric = min(toxvalNumeric)), 
            by = .(toxvalType, toxvalUnits, dtxsid)][order(toxvalType,
                                                           -toxvalNumeric)]
natadb_hazard[media %in% 'water' & toxvalType %in% c('LOEL', 'NOEL'), 
              .(toxvalNumeric = min(toxvalNumeric)), 
              by = .(toxvalType, toxvalUnits, dtxsid)][order(toxvalType,
                                                             -toxvalNumeric)]
```

Now, let us restrict our attention to human hazard and focus on the exposure routes given by inhalation and oral. 

First, let us determine the exposure routes in general.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health', unique(exposureRoute)]
natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health', unique(exposureRoute)]
```

Then, let's focus on the inhalation and oral exposure routes for human hazard.



To answer this, filter the data into the corresponding exposure routes, then group by exposure route and risk assessment class, and finally count the number of instances for each grouping. To determine the most represented class, one can order the results descending.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
              exposureRoute %in% c('inhalation', 'oral'), .(Hits = .N), 
            by = .(exposureRoute, riskAssessmentClass)][order(exposureRoute, 
                                                              -Hits)]
natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
                exposureRoute %in% c('inhalation', 'oral'), .(Hits = .N), 
              by = .(exposureRoute, riskAssessmentClass)][order(exposureRoute,
                                                                -Hits)]
```

*With these results we may answer **Environmental Health Question 6**:* After pulling the hazard data for the different data sets, list the different exposure routes for which there is data. What are the unique risk assessment classes for hazard values for the oral route and for the inhalation exposure route? For each such exposure route, which risk assessment class is most represented by the data sets?

**Answer**: We listed the general exposure routes above for the hazard data associated to the chemicals in each data set. Restricting our attention to human hazard data, the `acute` risk assessment class is most represented by the inhalation exposure route and `chronic` for the oral exposure route for both the CCL4 and NATADB data sets. 



We now drill down a little further before moving into a different path for data exploration. We explore the different types of toxicity values present in each data set for the inhalation and oral exposure routes, and then see which of these are common to both exposure routes for each data set.



To answer this, we filter the rows to the "human health" `humanEcoNT` value and "inhalation" or "oral" `exposureRoute` value. Then we return the unique values that `toxvalType` takes.

First we look at CCL4.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' &
              exposureRoute %in% c('inhalation'), unique(toxvalType)]
ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' &
              exposureRoute %in% c('oral'), unique(toxvalType)]
intersect(ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'inhalation', unique(toxvalType)], ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'oral', unique(toxvalType)])
```

Then we look at NATADB.

```{r}
natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
                exposureRoute %in% c('inhalation'), unique(toxvalType)]
natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
                exposureRoute %in% c('oral'), unique(toxvalType)]
intersect(natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'inhalation', unique(toxvalType)], natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'oral', unique(toxvalType)])
```

*With the results above, we may answer **Environmental Health Question 7**:* There are several types of toxicity values for each exposure route. List the unique toxicity values for the oral and inhalation routes. What are the unique types of toxicity values for the oral route and for the inhalation route? How many of these are common to both the oral and inhalation routes for each data set?

**Answer**: There are 24 toxicity value types shared between the oral and inhalation exposure routes for CCL4 and 29 for NATADB. The lists above indicate the variety of toxicity values present in the hazard data for the two different exposure routes we have considered.


For the next data exploration, We will turn to the risk assessment class of `developmental`. We will examine the NOEL and LOEL values for chemicals with oral exposure, human hazard, and risk assessment class 'developmental'. We also examine the units to determine whether any unit conversions are necessary to compare numeric values.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'oral' &
              riskAssessmentClass %in% 'developmental' & 
              toxvalType %in% c('NOEL', 'LOEL'), ]
ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'oral' &
              riskAssessmentClass %in% 'developmental' &
              toxvalType %in% c('NOEL', 'LOEL'), unique(toxvalUnits)]
natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'oral' &
                riskAssessmentClass %in% 'developmental' &
                toxvalType %in% c('NOEL', 'LOEL'), ]
natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'oral' &
                riskAssessmentClass %in% 'developmental' & 
                toxvalType %in% c('NOEL', 'LOEL'), unique(toxvalUnits)]
```

Observe that for CCL4, the units are given by 'mg/kg-day' and 'ppm', while the units for NATADB are given by 'mg/kg-day', 'ppm', and 'ml/kg'. It is the case that 'mg/kg-day' and 'ppm' are comparable ratios. We ignore the 'ml/kg' units for now and group by DTXSID to find the lowest or highest value.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'oral' &
            riskAssessmentClass %in% 'developmental' & 
            toxvalType %in% c('NOEL', 'LOEL'),
            .(numeric_value = min(toxvalNumeric), 
            units = toxvalUnits[[which.min(toxvalNumeric)]]), 
            by = .(dtxsid, toxvalType)]
natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & exposureRoute %in% 'oral' &
              riskAssessmentClass %in% 'developmental' & 
              toxvalType %in% c('NOEL', 'LOEL'), 
              .(numeric_value = min(toxvalNumeric), 
              units = toxvalUnits[[which.min(toxvalNumeric)]]), 
              by = .(dtxsid, toxvalType)]
```

Now, we also explore the values of 'RfD', 'RfC', and 'cancer slope factor' of the `toxvalType` rows. We first determine the set of units for each, make appropriate conversions if necessary, and then make comparisons.

```{r}
ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & toxvalType %in% 
            c('cancer slope factor', 'RfD', 'RfC'), .N, 
            by = .(toxvalType, toxvalUnits)][order(toxvalType, -N)]
natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & toxvalType %in%
              c('cancer slope factor', 'RfD', 'RfC'), .N, 
              by = .(toxvalType, toxvalUnits)][order(toxvalType, -N)]
```
For CCL4, there are three inequivalent sets of units that need conversions. We convert to 'mg/m3', which means scaling values given in 'g/m3' by 1E3 and values given in 'ug/m3' by 1E-3. The Rfd units and cancer slope factor units require no conversions.

For NATADB, we need to convert RfC values from ppm to mg/m3, with a conversion factor that relies on the molecular weight of the chemical in question. We will remove these from consideration for now. The units for RfD and cancer slope factor require no conversions.

First, we filter and separate out the relevant data subsets.

```{r}
# Separate out into relevant data subsets
ccl4_csf <- ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
                          toxvalType %in% c('cancer slope factor'), ]
ccl4_rfc <- ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
                          toxvalType %in% c('RfC'), ]
ccl4_rfd <- ccl4_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
                          toxvalType %in% c('RfD'), ]
```

Then we start to handle the unit conversions.

```{r}
# Set mass by volume units to mg/m3, so scale g/m3 by 1E3 and ug/m3 by 1E-3
ccl4_rfc[toxvalUnits == 'mg/m3', conversion := 1]
ccl4_rfc[toxvalUnits == 'g/m3', conversion := 1E3]
ccl4_rfc[toxvalUnits == 'ug/m3', conversion := 1E-3]
ccl4_rfc[toxvalUnits %in% c('mg/m3', 'g/m3', 'ug/m3'), units := 'mg/m3']
# Set mass by mass units to mg/kg
ccl4_rfd[toxvalUnits %in% c('mg/kg-day', 'mg/kg'), conversion := 1]
ccl4_rfd[toxvalUnits %in% c('mg/kg-day', 'mg/kg'), units := 'mg/kg']
```

Then aggregate the data.

```{r}
# Run data aggregations grouping by dtxsid and taking either the max or the min
# depending on the toxvalType we are considering.
ccl4_csf[,.(numeric_value = max(toxvalNumeric), 
            units = toxvalUnits[which.max(toxvalNumeric)]), 
         by = .(dtxsid)][order(-numeric_value),]
ccl4_rfc[,.(numeric_value = min(toxvalNumeric*conversion), 
            units = units[which.min(toxvalNumeric*conversion)]), 
         by = .(dtxsid)][order(numeric_value),]
ccl4_rfd[,.(numeric_value = min(toxvalNumeric*conversion), 
            units = units[which.min(toxvalNumeric*conversion)]), 
         by = .(dtxsid)][order(numeric_value),]
```

Repeat the process for NATADB, first separating out the relevant subsets of the data.

```{r}
# Separate out into relevant data subsets
natadb_csf <- natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
                              toxvalType %in% c('cancer slope factor'), ]
natadb_rfc <- natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' &
                              toxvalType %in% c('RfC'), ]
natadb_rfd <- natadb_hazard[humanEcoNt %in% 'human health' & 
                              toxvalType %in% c('RfD'), ]
```

Now handle the unit conversions.

```{r}
# Set mass by mass units to mg/kg. Note that ppm is already in mg/kg
natadb_rfc <- natadb_rfc[toxvalUnits != 'ppm',]
natadb_rfd[, units := 'mg/kg-day']
```

Finally, aggregate the data.

```{r}
# Run data aggregations grouping by dtxsid and taking either the max or the min
# depending on the toxvalType we are considering.
natadb_csf[, .(numeric_value = max(toxvalNumeric), 
               units = toxvalUnits[which.max(toxvalNumeric)]), 
           by = .(dtxsid)][order(-numeric_value),]
natadb_rfc[, .(numeric_value = min(toxvalNumeric), 
               units = toxvalUnits[which.min(toxvalNumeric)]), 
           by = .(dtxsid)][order(numeric_value),]
natadb_rfd[, .(numeric_value = min(toxvalNumeric), 
               units = units[which.min(toxvalNumeric)]), 
           by = .(dtxsid)][order(numeric_value),]
```

*With these results, we may answer **Environmental Health Question 8**: When examining different toxicity values, the data may be reported in multiple units. To assess the relative hazard from this data, it is important to take into account the different units and adjust accordingly. List the units reported for the cancer slope factor, reference dose, and reference concentration values associated with the oral and inhalation exposure routes for human hazard. Which chemicals in each data set has the highest cancer slope factor, lowest reference dose, and lowest reference concentration values?

**Answer**: The units for these three toxicity value types for CCL4 are given by 'mg/m3', 'g/m3', 'ug/m3' for RfC, 'mg/kg-day', 'mg/kg' for RfD, and '(mg/kg-day)-1' for Cancer Slope Factor. For NATADB, the units for RfC are given by 'mg/m3' and 'ppm', for RfD by 'mg/kg-day', 'mg/kg', and for Cancer Slope Factor by '(mg/kg-day)-1'.  For CCL4, the chemical DTXSID2021028 has the highest CsF at 150 (mg/kg-day)-1, the chemical DTXSID1031040 has the lowest RfC value at 6.0e-9 mg/m3, and the chemical DTXSID7021029 has the lowest RfD value at 4e-6 mg/kg. For NATADB, the chemical DTXSID2020137 has the highest CsF at 500 (mg/kg-day)-1, the chemical DTXSID1020516 has the lowest RfC value at 2.0e-6 mg/m3, and the chemical DTXSID7021029 had the lowest RfD at 4e-6 mg/kg-day.

# Concluding remarks

In conclusion, we explored how one can access publicly available data from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard programmatically using the CCTE APIs via the ccdR R package. In the examples above, we investigated different types of data associated to chemicals, visualized and aggregated the data, and employed different data wrangling techniques using data.tables to answer the environmental health questions. With these tools, one can build workflows that take in a list of chemicals and gather and process data associated to those chemicals through the CCTE APIs. Consider how you might use this functionality for building models in your own work.
